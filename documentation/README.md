# Architectural Deep Dive & Production Principles for LLM Applications

This document provides a comprehensive architectural analysis of the AI PDF Chatbot project and distills the key principles for building robust, production-grade applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It is intended for engineers and architects who want to move beyond prototypes and build reliable, scalable, and maintainable LLM systems.

This document uses the current project as a case study and reference implementation for the principles discussed.
