# 6. Proposed Project Improvements

While the current architecture provides a robust foundation, a system should always be designed for evolution. This document outlines key improvements that could be implemented to enhance the application's intelligence, reliability, and efficiency. It serves as a roadmap for future development.

## Category 1: Enhancing Agentic Capabilities & Features

These improvements focus on making the agent "smarter" and more feature-rich.

### 1. Self-Correction and Iterative Retrieval

*   **The Problem:** The current agent performs a single, linear retrieval step. If the initial search results are poor or don't contain the answer, the agent can only give up and say "I don't know."

*   **The Improvement:** Evolve the `RetrievalGraph` from a simple chain into a cycle. 
    1.  After the `generateResponse` node, add a new `validateAnswer` node. This node would use an LLM to check if the generated answer is factually supported by the retrieved context.
    2.  Add a conditional edge from `validateAnswer`:
        *   **If Valid:** The graph proceeds to `END`.
        *   **If Invalid:** The graph routes to a new `refineQuery` node. This node would take the original query and the failed context and use an LLM to generate a better, more specific search query.
    3.  The `refineQuery` node would then loop back to the `retrieveDocuments` node, creating an iterative reasoning loop.

*   **The Value:** This transforms the system from a simple RAG chain into a true agent that can reason about its own performance and retry. It would dramatically improve accuracy for complex or ambiguously worded questions.

### 2. Persistent Chat History & User Authentication

*   **The Problem:** The chat history is ephemeral, stored only in the frontend's session state and lost on refresh. This prevents long-running, contextual conversations.

*   **The Improvement:**
    1.  Integrate an authentication solution into the frontend (e.g., NextAuth.js).
    2.  Modify the `AgentState` to include a `thread_id` or `user_id`.
    3.  Use the existing Supabase instance to create a `conversations` table to store message history, linking it to the user ID.
    4.  When a user starts a session, the application would load their previous message history into the graph's state, allowing for seamless continuation of conversations.

*   **The Value:** This creates a stateful, personalized experience that users expect from a production-grade chatbot.

### 3. Expanded Document Handling (Beyond PDF)

*   **The Problem:** The ingestion pipeline is currently specialized for PDF files only.

*   **The Improvement:** Generalize the `IngestionGraph`.
    1.  Add a new `identifyDocType` node at the start of the graph.
    2.  Based on the file's MIME type or extension (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`) or if the input is a URL, this node would route to different, specialized parsing nodes.
    3.  Implement a web scraping node using a library like Firecrawl (which is already a dependency) to handle URL ingestion.

*   **The Value:** This makes the chatbot dramatically more versatile, allowing it to become a central knowledge base for a wide range of data sources, not just PDFs.

## Category 2: Production Hardening & Reliability

These changes focus on making the system more robust and trustworthy for real-world use.

### 1. Implement a Comprehensive Evaluation Suite

*   **The Problem:** There is no automated way to measure the quality of the agent's responses or to prevent regressions when prompts or models are changed.

*   **The Improvement:**
    1.  Build a "golden dataset" of representative questions and their ideal, high-quality answers.
    2.  Create an evaluation script that runs the `RetrievalGraph` over this entire dataset.
    3.  Use an LLM-as-a-judge (e.g., GPT-4) to score the generated outputs against the golden answers on metrics like correctness, faithfulness (lack of hallucination), and conciseness.
    4.  Integrate this evaluation script into the CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run automatically on every pull request.

*   **The Value:** This provides a critical safety net against quality regressions and gives developers the confidence to iterate on and improve the system.

### 2. Advanced Graph Error Handling

*   **The Problem:** A failure in a critical node (e.g., an LLM API timeout) will likely cause the entire graph to crash, presenting a poor user experience.

*   **The Improvement:** Implement explicit error handling within the graph itself. For any node that performs a network request, configure it to route to a dedicated `handleFailure` node on error. This node would be responsible for logging the error and formulating a graceful, user-friendly fallback message (e.g., "I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge base right now, please try again in a moment.").

*   **The Value:** This makes the application more resilient and reliable from the user's perspective.

## Category 3: Efficiency & Cost Optimization

These changes focus on making the application faster and cheaper to operate at scale.

### 1. Pre-Filter for Trivial Queries

*   **The Problem:** The `checkQueryType` router uses a powerful LLM for every single message, which is expensive and slow for simple greetings or affirmations.

*   **The Improvement:** Before the `checkQueryType` node, add a simple, non-LLM `preFilter` node. This node would use regular expressions or keyword matching to instantly identify and route trivial messages (e.g., "hello", "thanks", "bye") to a simple, direct response without any LLM calls.

*   **The Value:** This would significantly reduce latency and cost for common, non-substantive interactions.

### 2. Duplicate Document Detection

*   **The Problem:** A user can upload the same document multiple times, leading to wasted processing, storage costs, and duplicate search results.

*   **The Improvement:** In the `IngestionGraph`, add a `checkForDuplicates` node before processing. This node would first compute a hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the document's content. It would then check a dedicated `document_hashes` table in the database. If the hash already exists, the graph can skip the ingestion process for that document entirely.

*   **The Value:** This prevents data redundancy, saves significant processing and storage costs, and improves the quality of search results.
