# 5. From Prototype to Production: Core Principles

Moving an LLM application from a proof-of-concept to a production system requires a rigorous focus on reliability, scalability, and safety. Here are the essential principles to guide that transition.

### 1. Observability is Non-Negotiable

You cannot manage what you cannot see. LLM systems are inherently complex and non-deterministic; deep visibility is a requirement, not a feature.

*   **Comprehensive Tracing:** Implement end-to-end tracing for every LLM call and agent step using a platform like LangSmith. Track inputs, outputs, latency, and token counts.
*   **State Logging:** For agentic workflows, log the full state object at every step. This provides a perfect audit trail for debugging.
*   **Key Metrics:** Monitor cost (cost per query), latency (p99 response time), error rates, and quality (user feedback, evaluation scores).

### 2. Isolate and Control Volatility

The LLM is the most unpredictable and expensive component. Your architecture must insulate the rest of your system from this volatility.

*   **Configuration-Driven Models:** Never hardcode model names. Externalize them in configuration to allow for instant swaps without redeployment.
*   **Structured Output:** For machine-readable decisions (like routing), use the model's tool-calling or structured output features (e.g., with Zod or Pydantic schemas). This is dramatically more reliable than parsing natural language.
*   **API Gateway:** Funnel all LLM calls through a central gateway to implement robust caching, retries with exponential backoff, and circuit breakers.

### 3. Build a Safety Net: Evaluation and Testing

Traditional unit tests are insufficient. You must also continuously evaluate the *quality* of the model's output.

*   **Unit Tests for Logic:** Test all deterministic parts of your code (utility functions, data transformations) with standard unit tests.
*   **Create an "Eval Set":** Curate a golden dataset of representative prompts and their ideal, high-quality responses.
*   **Continuous Evaluation:** After every significant change (e.g., a new prompt), run your system against the eval set. Use an "LLM-as-a-judge" to score the new outputs against the golden responses on criteria like correctness, relevance, and safety. This is your regression suite for quality.

### 4. Optimize for Both Cost and Performance

LLM applications can become prohibitively expensive. Architect your system to use resources intelligently.

*   **The Router Pattern:** This is the most critical cost-optimization strategy. Use a cheap, fast model to first classify the user's intent and then route to the appropriate tool. Don't use your most powerful RAG chain to answer "hello."
*   **Model Cascading:** For complex tasks, use a cheaper model for a first pass (e.g., drafting an answer) and a more powerful model for refinement or verification.
*   **Aggressive Caching:** Cache LLM responses for identical prompts. Cache expensive-to-generate embeddings and reuse them.

### 5. Design for Failure and Responsible AI

Assume the LLM will fail. It will generate incorrect, biased, or harmful content. Your application must have guardrails.

*   **Input/Output Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent prompt injection. Never trust the LLM's output blindly; validate and sanitize it before displaying it.
*   **Groundedness Checks:** For RAG, verify that the generated answer is actually supported by the retrieved documents. This can be done with another, smaller LLM call.
*   **Graceful Fallbacks:** Have pre-defined, user-friendly responses for when an LLM API fails or times out.
*   **Content Moderation:** Use moderation APIs to filter for harmful content in both user inputs and model outputs.
